## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Health Check

- [ ] Images optimized
- [ ] Assets cached properly

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **APP_KEY not set**: Generate with `openssl rand -hex 16`
2. **Database connection failed**: Check Railway MySQL service
3. **500 errors**: Check Railway logs with `railway logs`
4. **Assets not loading**: Ensure build completed successfully

### Useful Commands:
```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Check environment variables
railway variables

# Run artisan commands
railway run php artisan migrate
railway run php artisan config:clear

# SSH into container
railway shell
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoint
- URL: `/health`
- Expected response: JSON with status and database connection
- Railway uses this for health monitoring

### Logs
- Railway automatically captures stdout/stderr
- View with: `railway logs`
- Laravel logs go to stderr in production

## üîí Security Checklist

- [ ] `APP_DEBUG=false` in production
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (Railway handles this)
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Database credentials protected
